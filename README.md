# Gamereview database

## Import the Database


Go to the `/sql` directory and import the `spacex.sql` file in your database to get access to the tables for this exercise.

Execute the following command in this project directory with the `mysql` client:

```sql
source spacex.sql
```

Answer every question with:

1. The query that answers the question.
2. The results of that query.

Every query that returns more than 10 row must be reduced to the first 10 rows. (HINT you can do this in you query).
